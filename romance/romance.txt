////QUESTIONS////

+ (what is the romance genre|what makes a book romance)
- Two basic elements comprise every romance novel: a central love story and an emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending.\n
^ The main plot centers around individuals falling in love and struggling to make the relationship work. \n
^ A writer can include as many subplots as he/she wants as long as the love story is the main focus of the novel.\n
^ Romance novels may have any tone or style, be set in any place or time, and have varying levels of sensuality—ranging from sweet to extremely hot.\n
^ These settings and distinctions of plot create specific subgenres within romance fiction. 

+ (romance subgenre)
- The primary Romance subgenres include:
^ Contemporary Romance\n
^ Erotic Romance\n
^ Historical Romance\n
^ Paranormal Romance\n
^ Spiritual Romance\n
^ Romantic Suspense\n
^ Fantasy Romance\n
^ New Adult Romance\n
^ Young Adult Romance

+ (romance tropes)
- In addition to romance books organized by categories by these sub-genres, they may also fit a specific romance trope.\n
^ A romance trope is a plot device or theme used within a romance novel giving a recognizable starting point to the story that a reader can recognize.\n
^ Though many romance books can use one common romance trope, it is their storylines and characters that differentiate each book using this common plot device.\n
^ Romance authors can use more than one romance trope within a novel and these romance tropes can be found within any romance sub-genre.\n
^ The most common romance tropes include:
^ Best Friend’s Brother/Sister or Brother/Sister’s Best Friend\n
^ Billionaire Romance/Secret Billionaire\n
^ Enemies to Lovers\n
^ Fake Relationship\n
^ Forbidden Romance\n
^ Office Romance

+ (what are the characteristics of romance novels|what are some romance novel characteristics)
- At its core, a romance novel is about a developing romance between a hero and a heroine. Here are some common characteristics of romance novels that span subgenres:
^ There must be a conflict challenging the relationship that needs to be overcome.\n
^ The stories are aspirational, and so issues outside of the central courtship are limited.\n
^ Romance novels are generally told through the perspective of a woman and feature strong-willed and clever female characters.\n
^ All romance novels follow the moral principle that good behavior is rewarded with unconditional love.\n
^ Most important of all, the stories have a happy ending.
